VBScript is a terrible language.
This extension makes it tolerable.




Quick Start
====================

Installation:
1. Copy this project onto your local machine.
2. Add the project's   \bin   folder to your PATH environment variable.
   If you are installing Tolerable just for local use, then your PATH
   will look something like this:

      C:\tolerable\bin;%PATH%



Executing a VBScript using Tolerable:
1. Open a command prompt.
2. Execute your VBScripts using the (new)   t    command.  For example:


   C:\tolerable\examples\basic\closures> t using_store.vbs
